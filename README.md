# Apple Software Update Service Downloader

A downloader for macOS disk images from Apple System Update Service (SUS) also
known as SWScan.

This is a "port" of https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM (really, a rewrite)

The DMG download part is done, the DMG to IMG part is in progress and the Qemu
wrapper part is to be done.
